# SCORE API

> Web Service example with Rust.

REST API, written in Rust, for managing a simple game which uses a leaderboard with players submitting new scores from around the world.

This service is responsible for taking player score submissions and returning leaderboard data either globally or country-specific.

Players get points by submitting scores and they are placed on the leaderboard by their scores.
